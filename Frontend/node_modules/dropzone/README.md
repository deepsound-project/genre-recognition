Dropzone.js is a light weight JavaScript library that turns an HTML element into a dropzone.
This means that a user can drag and drop a file onto it, and the file gets uploaded to the server via AJAX.

This is no longer the official repository for Dropzone. I have switched to [gitlab.com](https://gitlab.com/meno/dropzone)
as the primary location to continue development.
 
There are multiple reasons why I am switching from GitHub to GitLab, but one of the main reasons are the ridiculous
issue tracker that GitHub is providing, *drowning* me in issues that I am unable to categorise or prioritize properly,
the lack of proper continuous integration, and build files. I don't want the compiled `.js` files in my repository, and
people regularly commit changes to the compiled files and create pull requests with them.

I will write a blog post soon, that goes into detail about why I am doing the switch.

This repository will still remain, and always host the most up to date versions of dropzone, but only the distribution
files!
